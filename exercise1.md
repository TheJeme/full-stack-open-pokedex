I will pick Python for the programming language on the application, because I have used it before.

For linting I would use Pylint. That is very common linting tool for python and I have used it before.

For testing I would use unittest module. I have not used it before but it seems really easy to use.

For building I would use PyBuilder. I don't know a lot about it but I think it should be good for our needs.

Alternatives besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions are TeamCity that comes with both free and proprietary licenses. This is made by JetBrains who has made many good development tools so I would definitely want to try that. Maybe I would even pick that for our application. I really like Pycharm from them so maybe they go well together for my team.

Other alternative is GitLab that I have heard a lot good before. It has free version and should be easy to setup.

This setup would be better to be hosted in cloud-based environment, because our team consists only from 6 people. Our team is very small and we would need someone who is able to set up self-hosted CI. To do that one of the team should have skills for that and it would definitely take time that slows down the main product. If our product would grow a lot bigger or uses a lot of resources and become expensive, then we can switch to self-hosted solution.
